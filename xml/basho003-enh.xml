         <sense resp="Jeffrey Kotyk">The concept of <foreign lang="zh">tian</foreign>, usually translated as 'heaven', was one idea that was taken under deep consideration by every school of classical Chinese philosophy. Approaches can be distinguished into two main type: one of theism, which attributed human characteristics and a sentient, divine nature to <foreign lang="zh">tian</foreign>, believing that it acted in resonance with human beings, dispensing rewards and punishments. This idea became particularly useful when the Han and later emperors needed to solidify their authority. The other major approach was nontheistic, tending to see <foreign lang="zh">tian</foreign> as nature itself and as such indifferent to human activities. These schools of thought reflect the intellectual and philosophical development that was occurring throughout the history of early Chinese civilization.
The theist interpretation dominated throughout the Zhou period, but from the Spring and Autumn Period unto the rise of Han Dynasty (206 BCE), the nontheistic understanding gained traction in philosophical circles. Starting in the Han dynasty the theist perspective received endorsement from the state, which sought to legitimize its hegemony. A form of divination called <foreign lang="zh">chenwei</foreign> 讖緯 was based on the belief in the possibility to perceive the designs of <foreign lang="zh">tian</foreign> through observing patterns in natural phenomena. They took heaven to be a conscious entity with a will of its own. They further thought that the emperor possessed a divine nature and ability to ascertain and carry out the will of heaven. Wang Chong 王充, a rationalist philosopher of the Han Dynasty, absolutely rejected such thinking that had become commonplace among the intellectual elite of his age, insisting that heaven and earth were purely of material form and not possessed of any sort of conscious divinity. However, it seems that theistic approach was far more useful in establishing state authority and so that argument eventually won out and became the dominant perspective for successive dynasties until the modern day.
